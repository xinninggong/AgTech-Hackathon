# Hackathon

From 15th to 16th March 2019, The Marae team worked to produce a web app aimed to optimise kiwifruit productivity for Zespri. 
Within the 40 hour time frame, we created a prototype on Adobe XD as well as a working web page.
We presented our solution at the Central Districts Field Days in Feilding and was awarded second place for our efforts. 

The web app we designed as two parts, one for the users being the workers and another for the managers who will assign areas for the workers to prune.
